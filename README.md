Face Recognition Based Attendance System
A Python-based face recognition attendance system with an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). This project automates the attendance process by recognizing faces through a webcam and marking attendance in real-time.

🧠 Overview
This application allows for seamless attendance tracking using facial recognition technology. Built with Python and integrated with a user-friendly GUI using Tkinter, the system captures faces, trains the recognition model, and records attendance securely. It is suitable for classrooms, labs, and other controlled environments.

🚀 Technologies Used
Tkinter – for designing the graphical user interface

OpenCV – for capturing images and implementing face recognition (cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create())

NumPy, Pandas, CSV, datetime – for data handling, storage, and processing

🔐 Key Features
✅ User-Friendly Interface – Simple and interactive GUI for smooth user experience

🔒 Secure Registration – Password-protected access for new face registrations

📝 Automatic CSV Logging – Student details saved and updated in CSV files

📅 Daily Attendance Records – Generates daily attendance logs with accurate timestamps

📊 Live Updates – Displays real-time attendance in a structured table format (ID, Name, Date, Time)
